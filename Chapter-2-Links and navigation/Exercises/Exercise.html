                Gameplay
            </h2>

                <p>

                    Octopath Traveler features a graphical aesthetic known as "HD-2D", defined by the developers as combining retro <br>
                    Super NES-style character sprites and textures with polygonal environments and high-definition effects. <br>
                    
                    Players start the game by choosing a protagonist from one of eight adventurers, each of whom begins their journey <br>
                    in different parts of the world. Once a protagonist character is chosen, they cannot be removed from the active <br>
                    party until their story arc, which consists of four chapters, is concluded. Characters not chosen as the protagonist <br>
                    may be recruited at their starting locations. <br><br>
                    
                    Each character is paired with a distinct character class ("job"). It cannot be altered through gameplay. However, <br>
                    players can unlock the ability to assign a different character's class as a "subjob," which can be changed at any <br>
                    time but can only be assigned to one character at a time. <br><br>
                    
                    Each player character has a unique "Path Action" command that can be used when interacting with NPCs: The Warrior <br>
                    Olberic and the Hunter H'aanit can challenge characters; the Apothecary Alfyn and the Scholar Cyrus can inquire about <br>
                    certain bits of information that can be used for completion of quests or in the form of hidden items; the Merchant <br>
                    Tressa and the Thief Therion can acquire items directly from NPCs, one via commerce and the other via pickpocketing; <br>
                    and the Cleric Ophilia and the Dancer Primrose can guide NPCs and use them as guest summons. In all cases, the first <br>
                    action is a "Noble" Path Action: the ability's effectiveness dependent by the character's level or amount of in-game <br>
                    currency. The others are "Rogue" actions, which can be used on anyone but carries a risk of its user losing credibility <br>
                    with other NPCs. When the player loses enough reputation in a given town, they can no longer use any Path Actions in <br>
                    that town until a fee has been paid to restore the party's reputation. <br><br>
                    
                    The game features a turn-based battle system. All characters can attack with weapons, use abilities, use consumable items, <br>
                    and flee. The battle system is oriented around two features, "Break and Boost". <br>
                    
                    <ul>

                        <li>
                            Every foe comes with a set number of "Shield Points" and a series of weaknesses, which are unrevealed when the <br>
                            party first encounters that foe. Weaknesses correspond to one of the six different kinds of weapons, or six <br>
                            elemental attacks, in the game. If an enemy is struck, using something it is vulnerable to, an equal or greater <br>
                            number of times than it has Shield Points, the enemy is "Broken;" it loses its next turn and takes increased <br>
                            damage. However, once it gets a turn, it is guaranteed to act before the player does, preventing the player <br>
                            from locking it.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Each party member receives a Boost Point at the beginning of every turn, and may store up to five at a time. <br>
                            During their turn, a player can use up to three Boost Points to either strike with their weapons multiple <br>
                            times or increase the potency of an ability. A Boost Point is not gained the turn after using them.
                        </li>

                <p>

                    Octopath Traveler is set in the land of Orsterra, which was created by thirteen deities. One of them, the fallen <br>
                    god Galdera, was sealed away within the afterworld by the other deities after he refused to relinquish what they <br>
                    created. The Order of the Sacred Flame, the continent's dominant church, formed to worship the leader of the <br>
                    non-fallen gods, which continue to preside over Orsterra.<br><br>
                    
                    The player follows the stories of eight heroes as they journey through Orsterra.<br>
                    
                    <ul>

                        <li>
                            Ophilia Clement, a priestess of the Sacred Flame, undertakes a religious pilgrimage to keep the Sacred Flame <br>
                            burning. She is opposed by Mattias, who attempts to steal the Sacred Flame for his own ends. Ophilia's character <br>
                            class, Cleric, allows her to heal and defend the party.

                            Far Reaches of Hell. Cyrus is a Scholar and wields magical attack spells.
                        </li>

                            Tressa Colzione, a merchant, is inspired to go see the world after acquiring a journal detailing someone's past <br>
                            travels throughout the continent. Tressa's character class, Merchant, allows her to maximize the gaining of money.
                        </li>

                        <li>Olberic Eisenberg, a former knight of the Kingdom of Hornburg, seeks renewed purpose after his kingdom was <br>
                            destroyed in an attack by a sellsword named Werner. A Warrior, Olberic excels at defending his allies from physical attacks.
                        </li>

                        <li>Primrose Azelhart, a dispossessed noblewoman, seeks revenge against the Obsidians, a criminal organization that <br>
                            murdered her father. A Dancer, Primrose has the ability to temporarily strengthen her allies with magical dances.
                        </li>

                        <li>Alfyn Greengrass is a traveling healer who was inspired to take up the trade after a stranger, whose name he <br>
                            does not know, saved him from a terminal disease as a child. An Apothecary, Alfyn can "Concoct" by combining <br>
                            reagents for various offensive and defensive purposes.
                        </li>

                        <li>Therion, a criminal, is tasked by a noble family to recover a set of dragonstones belonging to them. Therion, <br>
                            a Thief, can Steal items from enemies and NPCs, and also temporarily weaken them.
                        </li>

                        <li>H'aanit, a huntress, is tracking her mentor after he left their village to hunt a beast called Redeye. The <br>
                            Hunter class allows H'aanit a limited ability to snare and slow enemies. She can also "Capture" beasts for <br>
                            later use as helpers.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                </p>

                <p>

                    After progressing through all the characters' various stories, the heroes' quests become intermingled as Ophilia's <br>
                    enemy Mattias, Cyrus' enemy Lucia, the Obsidians, and Olberic’s enemy Werner are all revealed to have been under <br>
                    the employ of the immortal witch Lyblac. Revealed to be Galdera's daughter, Lyblac orchestrated the acquisition of <br>
                    From the Far Reaches of Hell and the dragonstones to unseal the Gate of Finis in order to access the afterworld; <br>
                    she also orchestrated the fall of Hornburg, as it stands atop the Gate. Using the Obsidians as her personal army <br>
                    to eliminate threats like Primrose's father, Lyblac also attempted to use Graham Crossford, the man who wrote <br>
                    Tressa's journal and saved Alfyn as a boy, as a vessel for Galdera to gain corporeal form due to his bloodline's <br>
                    ties to the god. Graham escaped from her clutches, but was mutated into H’aanit’s enemy Redeye. This forced Lyblac <br>
                    to seek out Graham's only living son Kit to complete the ritual.<br><br>

                    At the Gate of Hornburg, Lyblac fully resurrects Galdera and is absorbed into him. The eight heroes fight a vicious <br>
                    battle against Galdera, sealing him back into the afterworld and saving Kit, who receives closure with his father's spirit.<br>
