        <!-- Explanation of the components of Tapsilog -->
        The word Tapsilog is an acronym that stands for Tapa Sinangag at Itlog. These are the three components of the meal. <br>
        Tapa refers to beef tapa. This are fried marinated beef slices. Sinangag, on the other hand, is a word used to refer <br>
        to garlic fried rice. The last three letters of the word tapsilog is derived from the filipino translation for egg, <br>
        which is itlog. A piece of egg is fried and forms part of the meal. <br><br>
